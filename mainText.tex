\section{Computational experiments} \label{sec:experiments}

% Computational envoirnment description
The computational experiments have been done on a single core of an Intel
with x.x Ghz clock and x Gb of RAM,
unning underthe  operating  system  Linux  Ubuntu.
We used the ILOG  CPLEX  solver  version  12.8  with default parameters setting. 
The algorithms were implemented in C{}\verb!++! along with the ILOG Concert Technology and compiled with the GNU g{}\verb!++! 8.2.0. 
The running time of all algorithms has been set to 7200 seconds.
